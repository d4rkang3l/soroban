Soroban (算盤/Abacus)
===========

Calculator Library in Java. This library is my attempt at the infamous "calculator app"

Contents:
   - Lexer implementation. Character/Token stream generators.
   - The Parser, single pass via Pratt Parser. Can parse prefix/postfix/infix/mixfix mathematical grammars. Produces Expression trees.
   - Expression Evaluator, consumes an expression and attempts to evaluate it recursively. Supports partially solving functions, and variables.
   - Custom function support via the FunctionDictionary class. Unary, Binary, Poly parameter function support.
   - BigRational class which supports fraction/decimal math in attempt to delay loss of precision until as late in the calculation as possible.
   - Variable Support
   - Constant Support
   - Lots of tests.
   
Todo:
   - Add constants
   - Simplify fractions.
   - Some cases auto convert from integer to decimal in strange ways, investigate.
   - Add pretty expression printing
   - Add assignment for variables / expressions
  
    
Examples:
   - `(x + y) * x`
   - `log10(10)`
   - `ln(2.718)`
   - `10!`
   - `-n`
   - `a + b`
   - `0b101`
   - `0xFF + 0x01`
   - `-((10 ^ 2) / 4 + 25) * (1 + 1)`
   - `sin(rad(45 + 45))`
   - `sin(45) + cos(45)`
   - `add(a, b, c)`
   - `add((a + a), (b + b))`
